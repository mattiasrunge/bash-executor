## About This Fork

This project is a fork of the original [bash-parser](https://github.com/vorpaljs/bash-parser) project, which appears to be unmaintained.

### Objectives

- Minimize dependencies where feasible
- Migrate the codebase to TypeScript
- Ensure compatibility with [Deno](https://deno.com/) instead of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Update the API to support asynchronous resolvers
- Perform code cleanup and refactoring
- Distribute releases via [JSR](https://jsr.io/)

### Non-Objectives

- No guarantee of compatibility with the original project
- No guarantee of full `bash` compatibility, though contributions are welcome
- Maintain only a `bash` parser to simplify the project, without separate `posix` and `bash` parsers

## Features

- Parses bash source code to produce an AST
- Supports asynchronous resolvers
- Compatible with Deno

## Installation

```bash
deno add @ein/bash-parser
# or
jsr add @ein/bash-parser
```

## Usage

```ts
import parse from '@ein/bash-parser';

const ast = await parse('echo ciao');
```

`ast` result is:

```js
{
  type: "Script",
  commands: [
    {
      type: "Command",
      name: {
        text: "echo",
        type: "Word"
      },
      suffix: [
        {
          text: "ciao",
          type: "Word"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Options

You can pass an options object to the `parse` function to customize its behavior.

```ts
export type Options = {
  /**
   * Which mode to use for the parsing. The mode specifies the tokenizer, lexer phases, grammar, and AST builder to use. Default is `bash`.
   */
  mode?: string;

  /**
   * If `true`, includes lines and columns information in the source file.
   */
  insertLOC?: boolean;

  /**
   * A callback to resolve shell alias. If specified, the parser calls it whenever it needs to resolve an alias. It should return the resolved code if the alias exists, otherwise `null`. If the option is not specified, the parser won't try to resolve any alias.
   *
   * @param name - The name of the alias to resolve.
   * @returns The resolved code if the alias exists, otherwise `null`.
   */
  resolveAlias?: (name: string) => Promise<string | undefined>;

  /**
   * A callback to resolve environment variables. If specified, the parser calls it whenever it needs to resolve an environment variable. It should return the value if the variable is defined, otherwise `null`. If the option is not specified, the parser won't try to resolve any environment variable.
   *
   * @param name - The name of the environment variable to resolve.
   * @returns The value if the variable is defined, otherwise `null`.
   */
  resolveEnv?: (name: string) => Promise<string | null>;

  /**
   * A callback to resolve path globbing. If specified, the parser calls it whenever it needs to resolve path globbing. It should return the expanded path. If the option is not specified, the parser won't try to resolve any path globbing.
   *
   * @param text - The text to resolve.
   * @returns The expanded path.
   */
  resolvePath?: (text: string) => Promise<string>;

  /**
   * A callback to resolve users' home directories. If specified, the parser calls it whenever it needs to resolve a tilde expansion. If the option is not specified, the parser won't try to resolve any tilde expansion. When the callback is called with a null value for `username`, the callback should return the current user's home directory.
   *
   * @param username - The username whose home directory to resolve, or `null` for the current user.
   * @returns The home directory of the specified user, or the current user's home directory if `username` is `null`.
   */
  resolveHomeUser?: (username: string | null) => Promise<string>;

  /**
   * A callback to resolve parameter expansion. If specified, the parser calls it whenever it needs to resolve a parameter expansion. It should return the result of the expansion. If the option is not specified, the parser won't try to resolve any parameter expansion.
   *
   * @param parameter - The name of the parameter to resolve.
   * @returns The result of the parameter expansion.
   */
  resolveParameter?: (parameter: string) => Promise<string>;

  /**
   * A callback to execute a `simple_command`. If specified, the parser calls it whenever it needs to resolve a command substitution. It receives as argument the AST of a `simple_command` node, and shall return the output of the command. If the option is not specified, the parser won't try to resolve any command substitution.
   *
   * @param command - The name of the command.
   * @param cmdAST - The AST of the simple command to execute.
   * @returns The output of the command.
   */
  execCommand?: (command: string, scriptAST: AstNodeScript) => Promise<string>;

  /**
   * A callback to execute an `arithmetic_expansion`. If specified, the parser calls it whenever it needs to resolve an arithmetic substitution. It receives as argument the AST of an `arithmetic_expansion` node, and shall return the result of the calculation. If the option is not specified, the parser won't try to resolve any arithmetic expansion substitution. Please note that the arithmetic expression AST is built using [babel/parser](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-parser), the AST specification can be found there.
   *
   * @param expression - The arithmetic expression to evaluate.
   * @param arithmeticAST - The AST of the arithmetic expression to evaluate.
   * @returns The result of the calculation.
   */
  runArithmeticExpression?: (expression: string, arithmeticAST: AstNode) => Promise<string>;
};
```

Example usage with options:

```ts
import parse from '@ein/bash-parser';

const options = {
  mode: 'bash',
  insertLOC: true,
  resolveEnv: (name) => process.env[name] || null,
};

const ast = await parse('echo $HOME', options);
```

## Documentation

### AST

The Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) types represent the hierarchical structure of the source code. Each node in the AST corresponds to a specific language construct.

All the types are described in [`types.ts`](./src/ast/types.ts).`

### How the parser works

#### Lexer (Tokenizer)

The lexer, also known as the tokenizer, is responsible for converting the raw source code into a sequence of tokens. Tokens are the smallest units of meaning, such as keywords, operators, identifiers, and literals.

##### Process:

- The `tokenize` function takes a set of reducers and returns a generator function that processes the source code.
- It iterates through the source code character by character, applying reducers to generate tokens.
- The state is updated and tokens are emitted as they are identified.

#### Parser

The parser takes the sequence of tokens produced by the lexer and organizes them into a structured format called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST represents the hierarchical structure of the source code.

##### Process:

- The `astBuilder` function creates an AST builder object with methods to construct various AST nodes.
- These methods are used to build different parts of the AST, such as commands, loops, conditionals, etc.
- The AST nodes include location information to map back to the original source code.

#### AST Builder

The AST builder is a utility that helps in constructing the AST nodes. It provides methods to create different types of nodes and set their properties, including source location information.

##### Process:

- The AST builder methods are used by the parser to create nodes for different language constructs.
- Each method takes relevant information (e.g., patterns, body, location) and returns an AST node.

### Flow

1. **Tokenization:** The lexer (`tokenize` function) processes the source code and generates tokens.
2. **Parsing:** The parser consumes these tokens and uses the AST builder to construct the AST.
3. **AST Building:** The AST builder methods are called by the parser to create nodes for different constructs, organizing the tokens into a hierarchical structure.

#### Example Flow

**Source Code:** `let x = 5;`

1. **Lexer:** Converts to tokens: `LET`, `IDENTIFIER(x)`, `EQUALS`, `NUMBER(5)`, `SEMICOLON`
2. **Parser:** Consumes tokens and uses AST builder to create nodes:
   - `VariableDeclaration` node with child nodes for `Identifier` and `Literal`
3. **AST Builder:** Methods like `variableDeclaration`, `identifier`, and `literal` are called to create and link nodes.
